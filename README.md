## Description
Learning Log is a web application that allows users to log and track their learning progress. Users can create topics and make entries under each topic to document what they have learned. This project is inspired by the "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes.

## Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learning_log.git
    cd learning_log
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv ll_env
    source ll_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `ll_env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the database:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

6. **Open your browser and navigate to:**
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:8000
    ```
